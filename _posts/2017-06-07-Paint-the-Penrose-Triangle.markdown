> You can never find such a impossible figure in real world. But you can draw it on paper.

Let's paint a equilateral triangle first.

Then extend the 3 edges of our triangle like below.

Next, draw 3 parallel lines outside starting from the end of extended edges.

Repeat the last step and you will see the graph is around to complete.

Now draw 3 short parallel lines.

Finally paint the color.

ALL DONE. Congratulations!
